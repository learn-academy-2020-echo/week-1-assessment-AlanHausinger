# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a group of statements that preform a certain task.

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable pieces of code that are usually called upon a lot. They also
  can have information pushed through what we call an argument.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: A .map goes through an array and returns one with the same length. A .filter
  filters out some type of value.

  Researched answer: So .map goes through an array and returns another one with the
  the same length, .filter does almost the same thing but only returns the
  ones with true statement that you decided.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log(), is like your "go" button because without it a lot of arrays won't be able to run.
  A return is used when you input something into you console but will only return what you tell it to.

  Researched answer:console.log(), is almost you could say a go button because it
  itll print things to the console so it can start the code. A return wont start
  your console and only return something you put into it.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument in a function is a way to pass information in the function.

  Researched answer: An argument contains outside information that a function needs in order to execute properly.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Its when one person is writing the code while the other can try to help with useful information
  and so that two head can take a look at a code and get two different mind trying to figure out the same
  problem.

  Researched answer: One is the driver with a switch off when the the pair seem fit. Usually after a few challenges
  or if one partner wants to show there solution or try at the challenge. While one is driving the other can give ideas or opinions on what todo on when writing the code.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Tdd is when you write out a test for your code then type it in and see why it was to fail.

  Researched answer: TDD is a process where you would have to write your test first, run the test and see why its
  failing, write a new code, run the test to see it passing, or refactor as necessary. with this it makes it much
  easier to see whats going on by breaking down this entire problem into smaller ones and working from there.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I really liked working in pairs because if we didn't I honestly would be having a much
  harder time than I would be right now. I'm more a visual learner so I like when we go over problems and see
  maybe go over one easy, medium and harder problem would really help and I think everyone would feel more
  comfortable after seeing an example.
